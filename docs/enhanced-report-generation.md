# Enhanced Report Generation System

## Overview

The BCMS now includes an enhanced report generation system that automatically integrates finance records into monthly and yearly sales reports. This system provides accurate profit/loss calculations by considering both sales revenue and operational costs.

## Key Features

### 1. **Finance Record Integration**
- Monthly and yearly reports now include finance costs and income
- Automatic calculation of net profit (sales profit - finance costs)
- Support for both expense and income finance records

### 2. **Automatic Report Regeneration**
- Reports automatically update when finance records are added, updated, or deleted
- Real-time recalculation of profit/loss figures
- Observer pattern ensures data consistency

### 3. **Auto-Generation for New Months**
- Automatic creation of monthly reports when a new month starts
- Seamless transition between reporting periods
- No manual intervention required

## System Architecture

### Components

#### 1. **ReportGenerationService** (`app/Services/ReportGenerationService.php`)
Enhanced with new methods:
- `generateMonthlyReport()` - Now includes finance cost calculations
- `generateYearlyReport()` - Now includes finance cost calculations
- `regenerateReportsForMonth()` - Manual regeneration for specific months
- `autoGenerateReportsForNewMonth()` - Automatic generation for new months

#### 2. **FinanceRecordObserver** (`app/Observers/FinanceRecordObserver.php`)
Automatically triggers report regeneration when finance records change:
- `created()` - When a new finance record is added
- `updated()` - When an existing finance record is modified
- `deleted()` - When a finance record is removed

#### 3. **Console Commands**
- `reports:auto-generate-monthly` - Auto-generate reports for new months
- `reports:regenerate-month {year} {month}` - Manual regeneration for specific months

## Report Calculations

### Monthly Reports

**Fields Added:**
- `finance_cost` - Total expenses for the month
- `total_finance_cost` - Net finance cost (expenses - income)
- `net_profit` - Final profit after finance costs

**Calculation Logic:**
```php
$totalFinanceCost = $financeRecords->where('type', 'expense')->sum('cost');
$totalFinanceIncome = $financeRecords->where('type', 'income')->sum('cost');
$netFinanceCost = $totalFinanceCost - $totalFinanceIncome;
$netProfit = $totalProfit - $netFinanceCost;
```

### Yearly Reports

**Fields Added:**
- `total_finance_cost` - Total net finance costs for the year
- `total_net_profit` - Final profit after all finance costs

**Calculation Logic:**
- Sums finance costs from monthly reports (for consistency)
- Falls back to direct calculation if no monthly reports exist

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Automatic Operation**
The system works automatically:
1. When a sale is made → Daily, monthly, and yearly reports are updated
2. When a finance record is added → Monthly and yearly reports are recalculated
3. When a new month starts → Monthly report is automatically created

### 2. **Manual Commands**

#### Auto-generate for new month:
```bash
php artisan reports:auto-generate-monthly
```

#### Regenerate reports for specific month:
```bash
php artisan reports:regenerate-month 2025 1
```

### 3. **API Integration**
Reports are automatically updated when finance records are created via API:
```json
POST /bcms/finance-records
{
    "description": "Office rent",
    "amount": 2000,
    "type": "expense",
    "date": "2025-01-15"
}
```

## Database Schema

### MonthlySalesReport Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE monthlysalesreport ADD COLUMN finance_cost DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE monthlysalesreport ADD COLUMN total_finance_cost DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE monthlysalesreport ADD COLUMN net_profit DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
```

### YearlySalesReport Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE yearlysalesreport ADD COLUMN total_finance_cost DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE yearlysalesreport ADD COLUMN total_net_profit DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/EnhancedReportGenerationTest.php`:

### Test Cases
1. **Monthly report includes finance costs** - Verifies finance integration
2. **Yearly report includes finance costs** - Verifies yearly calculations
3. **Finance record observer triggers regeneration** - Verifies automatic updates
4. **Auto-generation for new month** - Verifies automatic creation
5. **Manual regeneration command** - Verifies manual regeneration
6. **Finance income reduces net cost** - Verifies income handling

### Running Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/EnhancedReportGenerationTest.php
```

## Configuration

### Observer Registration
The FinanceRecordObserver is automatically registered in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`:
```php
FinanceRecord::observe(FinanceRecordObserver::class);
```

### Service Provider
The ReportGenerationService is available through Laravel's service container and can be injected where needed.

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes comprehensive logging:
- Report generation events
- Finance record changes
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance metrics

### Log Examples
```
INFO: Generated monthly sales report for 2025-1: 5 sales, $125000 revenue, $25000 profit, $1500 finance cost, $23500 net profit
INFO: Finance record created: Office rent for 2025-01-15
INFO: Regenerating reports for 2025-1 due to finance record changes
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Finance Record Management**
- Always set the correct `record_date` for accurate monthly allocation
- Use appropriate `type` ('expense' or 'income')
- Provide clear descriptions for audit trails

### 2. **Report Generation**
- Let the system handle automatic generation
- Use manual commands only for data corrections
- Monitor logs for any issues

### 3. **Performance**
- Reports are cached and regenerated only when needed
- Large datasets are handled efficiently through database queries
- Observer pattern ensures minimal overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reports not updating after finance record creation**
   - Check if FinanceRecordObserver is registered
   - Verify finance record has correct `record_date`
   - Check application logs for errors

2. **Incorrect finance cost calculations**
   - Verify finance record `type` is correct ('expense' or 'income')
   - Check if records are in the correct month/year
   - Use manual regeneration command to force recalculation

3. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Consider running reports during off-peak hours
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Check for unnecessary report regenerations

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check current month report
php artisan tinker --execute="echo App\Models\MonthlySalesReport::where('year', date('Y'))->where('month', date('n'))->first();"

# Check finance records for current month
php artisan tinker --execute="echo App\Models\FinanceRecord::whereYear('record_date', date('Y'))->whereMonth('record_date', date('n'))->get();"

# Force regenerate current month
php artisan reports:regenerate-month $(date +%Y) $(date +%-m)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Quarterly Reports** - Intermediate reporting periods
2. **Finance Categories** - Detailed cost breakdown by category
3. **Budget vs Actual** - Comparison with budgeted amounts
4. **Export Functionality** - PDF/Excel report exports
5. **Email Notifications** - Automatic report delivery

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Accounting Systems** - Import finance records from external systems
2. **Banking APIs** - Automatic transaction categorization
3. **Tax Reporting** - Automated tax calculation and reporting
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Real-time financial metrics
